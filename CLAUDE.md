## What this repo is

The AI agent backend for BIA. An Express server (Node 20+) that runs George Tirebiter, BIA's bilingual AI companion for USC international students. Lives on three platforms:

- **Web chat** at https://uscbia.com/george/chat → POST `/chat` (relayed via `/api/george/chat` in bia-roommate)
- **iMessage** (private beta, Mac-host only) via `@photon-ai/imessage-kit`
- **WeChat Official Account** (coming next) via the XML webhook adapter

The full persona, voice fingerprint, sub-agent split, and domain rules live in `AGENT.md` and `src/agent/personality.ts`. Read those before changing how George talks. Voice is the product here, not the wiring.

## What this repo is NOT

- **Not a Next.js project.** Express only. No SSR, no JSX, no `app/`.
- **Not a place for user-facing pages.** The `/george` marketing page and `/george/chat` UI live in bia-roommate. This repo serves an HTTP API.
- **Not the Supabase schema owner.** Migrations live in bia-admin/supabase/migrations. This repo reads from and writes to existing tables (`students`, `messages`, `reminders`, `events`).
- **Not cloud-friendly out of the box.** The iMessage adapter requires macOS + Full Disk Access. To deploy to Fly.io or Railway, set `IMESSAGE_ENABLED=false` and accept that iMessage stops working in that instance.

The relay in bia-roommate forwards to `GEORGE_BACKEND_URL` (Cloudflare quick tunnel today, named tunnel at `george-api.uscbia.com` planned). The contract is:

- Request: `POST /chat` with `Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN`, body `{ userId, platform: 'imessage' | 'wechat', text }`.
- Response: `{ response: string }` or `{ error: string }`.

If you change either side of that contract, the matching change goes in bia-roommate the same day.

## Dual-mode iMessage (Mac mini bridge + iPhone Shortcuts fallback)

Production runs the agent backend on a Cloudflare Container (outside the China firewall) and iMessage on a Mac in China. The connection between them is one of two paths, switchable by env vars on the China side.

```

                                                └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Path A (Mac mini bridge)** is the production-grade target. ~10s round-trip end-to-end. Single bearer hop. No queue. Same flow as today's George.

**Path B (iPhone Shortcuts)** is the no-Mac interim. Outgoing latency up to 60 seconds (the polling cadence). Personal Automation reliability has gaps. Use until the Mac mini arrives, then switch by disabling the iOS automations and starting the Mac mini bridge process.

Switch between the two by what's running on the China side:

| Running | Path active | Switch by |
|---|---|---|
| iPhone Shortcuts enabled, no Mac bridge | Path B | iOS Settings → Shortcuts → enable/disable Personal Automation |
| Mac mini `npm run dev` with `BACKEND_RELAY_URL` set | Path A | pm2 start/stop the bridge process |
| Both | Don't do this — double replies | Disable the iPhone Shortcuts before starting the Mac mini |

The Container always exposes both endpoint sets, so swapping doesn't require redeploying the backend.

## How to run locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, KIMI_API_KEY, APIFY_TOKEN,
# GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, ADMIN_TOKEN
npm run dev
```

Health check:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
# → {"status":"ok","character":"George — BIA 学长","tools":24}
```

Chat test (replace `$TOKEN` with your `ADMIN_TOKEN`):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"dev","platform":"imessage","text":"hi 学长"}'
```

### Running with iMessage

1. macOS Sequoia or later
2. iMessage signed in
3. Grant Full Disk Access to the node binary (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access → add `/opt/homebrew/bin/node` or your local node binary)
4. Set `IMESSAGE_ENABLED=true` in `.env`
5. `npm run dev` — the adapter starts watching the iMessage db on disk

### Running for web chat only (no iMessage)

1. `IMESSAGE_ENABLED=false`
2. Start a Cloudflare tunnel: `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3001`
3. Take the printed `*.trycloudflare.com` URL and set it as `GEORGE_BACKEND_URL` on bia-roommate's Vercel project
4. Set the same `ADMIN_TOKEN` value as `GEORGE_ADMIN_TOKEN` on Vercel
5. uscbia.com/george/chat now relays here

## How to deploy

**Mac-host (today's mode):** run on Bobby's Mac with `npm run dev` plus a `cloudflared` quick tunnel. iMessage works. Web chat works. Mac sleep or `cloudflared` exit = chat returns the fine-tune fallback message.

**Cloud (planned):** deploy via the included `Dockerfile` to Fly.io or Railway. Set `IMESSAGE_ENABLED=false`. Web chat works in the cloud. iMessage continues on the Mac as a parallel instance pointing at the same Supabase.

**Named tunnel (planned):** `cloudflared tunnel create george-api` + DNS CNAME at `george-api.uscbia.com` once the Cloudflare DNS migration finishes. Replaces the rotating quick-tunnel URL with a stable hostname.

## Guardrails

- **Persona is the product.** The rules in `AGENT.md` are non-negotiable. Read it before editing `src/agent/personality.ts` or `src/agent/bia-lore.ts`. The founder voice was distilled from real WeChat messages. Don't smooth it out.
- **No invented facts.** Course numbers, professor names, event dates, prices. If George doesn't know, he says "戳到知识盲区了😢" and uses a tool.
- **Tool registration is side-effect imports.** Every new tool file must be imported in `src/index.ts` to register itself with the tool registry. Forgetting this is the #1 "the tool exists but George can't call it" bug. There is no auto-discovery.
- **Supabase service-role key has full DB access.** Use it only inside `src/db/*` helpers. Never expose via HTTP. Never log it.
- **Rate limit on /chat.** 10 messages per minute per `userId` via the LRU cache in `src/adapters/rate-limiter.ts`. Don't bypass.
- **Injection filter at the door.** `checkInjection()` runs on every message before anything else. Don't skip.
- **Admin token gate on `/chat`.** Requires `Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN`. Never log the token or echo it in error responses.
- **Mac-only code stays env-gated.** Anything Photon SDK related sits behind `if (config.imessageEnabled)`. The cloud deploy depends on this. Importing the Photon SDK unconditionally breaks `npm install` on Linux.
- **Onboarding gates all other features.** Until the 4 profile fields (major, year, sleep habit, social visibility) are set, sub-agents return the onboarding prompt. Don't bypass.

## Cross-repo coordination

Changes here that require coordinated changes:

- **`/chat` request or response shape** → matching change in bia-roommate's `/api/george/chat` relay route.
- **New Supabase table or column** → schema migration goes in bia-admin first. George only reads or writes existing tables.
- **New env var George reads** → update `.env.example` here, update deploy docs, update Bobby's Mac `.env`, and if it's required for web chat too, set it on bia-roommate's Vercel project.
- **Behavioral changes that visitors will notice** (new tools, new sub-agent behavior, persona shifts) → ping Bobby. Web chat hits real users.

## Persona source map

For voice and persona edits, see the "Prompt source map" section in `AGENT.md`. All voice changes go through `src/agent/personality.ts` and `src/agent/bia-lore.ts`. The agent harness in `src/agent/george.ts` is wiring (rate limit, injection filter, intent classifier, tool-use loop, audit log). Voice does not belong there.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, use that skill's workflow before
answering directly. Persona work especially benefits from `/superpowers:brainstorming`
before code touches `personality.ts`.

Key routing rules:

- Persona / voice changes, "George doesn't sound right" → invoke brainstorming, then edit
- Bugs, "why isn't this tool firing", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- New tool design → invoke office-hours first
- Architecture or new sub-agent → invoke plan-eng-review
- Ship, deploy, create PR → invoke ship
